In this project, I used Python libraries to analyze and visualize financial data for Tesla. I began by extracting historical stock price data for Tesla using the yfinance library, which provided extensive time-series data on Tesla's share prices. This data was processed and visualized using Plotly to create a comprehensive stock and revenue dashboard.

For revenue data, I performed web scraping on a provided HTML page to gather Tesla's historical revenue figures. I utilized the requests library to download the webpage and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the relevant table containing revenue information. This data was then cleaned and formatted to ensure accuracy.

I integrated both datasets into a dual-panel graph using Plotly, displaying Tesla's share price and revenue trends. The graph includes a line chart for stock prices and another for revenue, providing insights into the company's financial performance over time. The visualizations were designed to highlight trends and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Overall, the project demonstrated my ability to collect, process, and visualize financial data, leveraging tools and techniques such as web scraping, data cleaning, and interactive plotting to deliver actionable insights.
